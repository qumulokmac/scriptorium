POSIX standard error codes

POSIX standard error codes, commonly known as system error codes or errno values. 
#################################################################################################################################

	ENOENT: “Error NO ENTry” – Indicates that a file or directory does not exist. 
		Commonly returned when a file operation (like open or read) tries to access a non-existent file.
	
	EACCES: “Error ACCess” – Indicates a permission denied error, usually occurring when the process 
		lacks the necessary permissions to access a file or directory.
	
	ENOMEM: “Error NO MEMory” – Means there is insufficient memory to complete an operation, 
		which might occur during memory allocation for processes.


POSIX standard error codes, also known as errno values, used to indicate various system call errors:

	1.	EPERM (1) – Operation not permitted
	2.	ENOENT (2) – No such file or directory
	3.	ESRCH (3) – No such process
	4.	EINTR (4) – Interrupted system call
	5.	EIO (5) – Input/output error
	6.	ENXIO (6) – No such device or address
	7.	E2BIG (7) – Argument list too long
	8.	ENOEXEC (8) – Exec format error
	9.	EBADF (9) – Bad file descriptor
	10.	ECHILD (10) – No child processes
	11.	EAGAIN (11) – Resource temporarily unavailable
	12.	ENOMEM (12) – Out of memory
	13.	EACCES (13) – Permission denied
	14.	EFAULT (14) – Bad address
	15.	ENOTBLK (15) – Block device required
	16.	EBUSY (16) – Device or resource busy
	17.	EEXIST (17) – File exists
	18.	EXDEV (18) – Invalid cross-device link
	19.	ENODEV (19) – No such device
	20.	ENOTDIR (20) – Not a directory
	21.	EISDIR (21) – Is a directory
	22.	EINVAL (22) – Invalid argument
	23.	ENFILE (23) – File table overflow
	24.	EMFILE (24) – Too many open files
	25.	ENOTTY (25) – Not a typewriter
	26.	ETXTBSY (26) – Text file busy
	27.	EFBIG (27) – File too large
	28.	ENOSPC (28) – No space left on device
	29.	ESPIPE (29) – Illegal seek
	30.	EROFS (30) – Read-only file system
	31.	EMLINK (31) – Too many links
	32.	EPIPE (32) – Broken pipe
	33.	EDOM (33) – Math argument out of domain of function
	34.	ERANGE (34) – Math result not representable

Additional Common Codes:

	•	ENOMSG – No message of desired type
	•	EIDRM – Identifier removed
	•	ENOLINK – Link has been severed
	•	EPROTO – Protocol error
	•	EBADMSG – Bad message
	•	EOVERFLOW – Value too large for defined data type
	•	ECANCELED – Operation canceled
	•	EOWNERDEAD – Owner died
	•	ENOTRECOVERABLE – State not recoverable
