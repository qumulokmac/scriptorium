FsxId093ccd2782b16e158::*> volume conversion start -vserver FSxN-SVM-001 -volume volconv -check-only true
Conversion of volume "volconv" in Vserver "FSxN-SVM-001" to a FlexGroup can proceed with the following warnings:
* After the volume is converted to a FlexGroup, it will not be possible to change it back to a flexible volume.
* The volume is nearly out of available space. Converting this volume to a FlexGroup might lead to "No space left on device" errors.
* It is recommended that the size of volume "volconv" in Vserver "FSxN-SVM-001" be at least "100GB" for optimal performance.
* Converting the volume to a FlexGroup will not add additional resources for capacity. After converting, use the "volume expand" command to add resources.
